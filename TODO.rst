TODO

A number of ideas are kept here for anyone wishing to help contribute to
the vmail project.

Ideas
-----

* Add support for banning IP addresses or individual users.
* Implement a vmail cli tool that can be used for manipulating the vmail
  database, adding new domains or users, banning people or IP addresses.
* Convert vmail to support a transactional model. This would primarily be
  useful for within qpsmtpd and would allow improved logging of messages
  in and out of the system.
